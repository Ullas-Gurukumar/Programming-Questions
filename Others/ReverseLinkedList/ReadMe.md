# Reverse Linked List by mutating

- Just something I thought of, wanted to see code it just to see if the algorithm I came up with actually works.
- Reversing a linked list without making any copy.

- Runtime Complexity: O(n), 1 pass through the list to reverse it.
- space Complexity: O(1), doesn't take any extra space, mutating existing objects.
