# Systems Design and Customer Centricity

## Customer Centric

First thing I do is communicate with the PM to determine what the intended user experience is for a service/feature.

### SGS

- We built a POC to validate our technology choices, how our service communicates and relies on Top Hat eco system.
- We got ready for beta release to collect user feedback and determine how the feature is used
- This gave us time to collect user data and address any gaps that might come up before full roll out.

### Page Service

- First feature we were migrating from Monolith was highlights/notes
- Our highest priority was to make sure there was no user impact during this migration, we created a migration strategy to ensure monolith would stay the source of truth until we are ready to claim SoT

### Notification Gateway

- We had plans to open the API to allow more notification and when covid hit, we had the ability to move quickly to help our customer better interact with their customers

### Mobile app -> E-POI card integration

Add new module system, weather system, configure a module with predetermined zip code

Service needs real weather data
